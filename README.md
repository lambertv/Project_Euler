Project_Euler
=============

My solutions to the math/programming problems at projecteuler.net

This repository is to document and organize my progress through projecteuler.net.
As a beginning programmer, I will use these problems to maintain my ability in Python and Java
while also trying to integrate the concepts I learned in my Data Structures class and Math 
Structures class last year. I will also take this opportunity to learn how to use Git and Github.

If you have any advice, comments, or criticisms, please tell me so I can improve!

Goal:

-Put up efficient, stand-alone solutions to the first 10 problems in java, Python, and C++.
-Put up parts of programs for the other problems when I solve them. Or the bare esscense of the problem/algorithm.
